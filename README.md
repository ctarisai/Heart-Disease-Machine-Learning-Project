# Heart-Disease-Machine-Learning-Project
This project builds on earlier work in applying Machine Learning to healthcare classification problems. The focus is to explore and evaluate how ML can be applied to the classification of heart disease. My role is to conduct both the EDA and an empirical evaluation of ML models, while communicating findings to technical/non-technical stakeholders.
